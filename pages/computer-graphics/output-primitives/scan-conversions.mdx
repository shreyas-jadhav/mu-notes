# 2.1 Scan conversions of point, line, midpoint algorithm for ellipse

## 1. Point

- Point plotting is accomplished by **converting a single coordinate position**,
  furnished by an application program into appropriate operations for the output
  device in use.
- For example, in CRT Monitor an electron beam is turned on.
- For black and white raster systems a bit values is set corresponding to specified screen position. Then, as the electron beam sweeps across each horizontal scan line, it emits a burst of electors whenever a value of 1 is encountered.

## 2. Line

- Line drawing is accomplished by **calculating intermediate positions along
  the line path** between two specified endpoint positions.
- An output device is then directed to **fill in these positions**
  between the endpoints.
- Digital devices display a straight line segment by plotting
  **discrete points**
  between the two endpoints.
- Discrete coordinate positions along the line path are
  calculated from the equation of the line and algorithms.
