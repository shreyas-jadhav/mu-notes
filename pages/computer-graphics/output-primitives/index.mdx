# 2. Output Primitives

- **Output Primitives** are some **basic geometric structures** which are used as terms to describe a scene.
- These output primitives can be grouped into sets to form a complex geometric structure.
- Each output primitive is specified with
  input **coordinate data** and other information about the way
  that object is to be displayed.
- **Points** and straight **line segments** are the simplest
  geometric components of pictures.
- Additional output primitives that can be used
  to construct a picture include **circles** and other **conic sections**, quadric surfaces,
  spline **curves** and surfaces, **polygon** color areas, and character strings.
