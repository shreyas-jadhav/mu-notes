# 1. Introduction and Overview of Computer Graphics

## Computer Graphics Defination

It is the use of computers to create and manipulate pictures on a display device. It comprises of software techniques to create, store, modify, represents pictures.

It may be defined as Pictorial Representation or graphical representation of objects in a computer.

## Uses / Applications of Computer Graphics

Computer graphics are used routinely in such diverse areas as science,
engineering, medicine, business, industry, government, art, entertainment, ad-
vertising, education, and training.

Following is a breif overview of some major fields using applications of Computer Graphics:

## Computer Aided Design (CAD)

- CAD, computer-aided design methods are used in the **design** of buildings, automobiles, aircraft, watercraft, space-
  craft, computers, textiles, and many, many other products.
- Animations are often used in CAD applications. Real-time animations using
  wireframe displays on a video monitor which are useful for **testing performance of a vehicles or system**.
- **Architects** use interactive graphics methods to lay out floor plans, that show the positioning of rooms, doon, windows, stairs, shelves, counters, and other building features.
- Working from the display of a building layout on a video monitor, an electrical designer can try out arrangements for wiring, electrical outlets, and fire warning systems

## Presentation Graphics

- Presentation graphics is commonly used to summarize financial, statistical, mathematical, scientific, and economic data for research reports, managerial reports, consumer information bulletins, and other types of reports.
- Typical examples of presentation graphics are bar charts, line graphs, surface graphs, pie charts, and other displays showing relationships between multiple parametem.

## Computer Art

- Computer graphics methods are widely used in both fine art and commercial art applications.
  **Artists** use a variety of computer methods, including special-purpose hardware, artist's **paintbrush** (such as Lumens), other **paint packages** (suchas Pixelpaint and Superpaint), specially developed software, symbolic
  mathematical packages (such as Mathematics), CAD packages, desktop publishing software, and animation packages that provide facilities for **designing object
  shapes and specifiying object motions**.
- Animations are also used frequently in **advertising**, and **television commercials** are produced frame by frame, where each frame of the motion is rendered and saved as an image file.

## Entertainment

- Computer graphics methods am now commonly used in making **motion pictures,music videos, and television shows**.

## Education and Training

- Computer-generated **models** of physical, financial, and economic systems are often used as educational aids.
- Examples of such specialized systems are the **simulators** for practice sessions or training of
  ship captains, aircraft pilots, heavy-equipment operators, and air trafficcontrol
  personnel.

## Visualization

- Scientists, engineers, medical personnel, business analysts, and others often need to analyze large amounts of information or to study the behavior of certain processes.
  **Producing graphical representations** for scientific, engineering, and medical data sets
  and processes is generally referred to as **scientific visualization**.
  And the term **business visualization** is used in connection with data sets related to commerce, industry, and other nonscientific areas.
- Mathematicians, physical scientists,and others use visual techniques to **analyze mathematical functions** and processes or simply to produce interesting
  graphical representations.

## Image Processing

- Image processing applies techniques to **modify or interpret existing pictures**, such as photographs and TV scans.
- Two principal applications of image processing are (1) **improving picture quality** and (2) **machine perception of visual information**, as used in robotics.
- Medical applications also make extensive use of imageprocessing techniques for picture enhancements,
  in **X-ray photography** and in simulations of operations.

## Graphical User Interface

- It is common now for software packages to provide a graphical interface.
- **Icons** represent options for painting, drawing, zooming, typing text strings, and other operations
  connected with picture construction.
- The **menus** can allow selection of processing options,
  color values, and graphics parameters.
